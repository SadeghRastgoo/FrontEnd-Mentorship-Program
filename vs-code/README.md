# How to customize your VSCode

## Extensions
> I have put all of the extensions installed on my VsCode in the file called 'extensions.json.' To install all of them, you have to create a directory called '.vscode,' and copy and paste the 'extensions.json,' and then while you opening your VsCode, it tells you as a recommendation that to install the extensions.

## Settings
>Initially, you have to install all of the extensions before and then copy & paste the entire file of "settings.json" into your settings in VsCode.

### Updates
> For future updates I will update this README.md for you.
